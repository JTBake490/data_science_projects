This is the second version/attempt at the credit card fraud dataset found on Kaggle. My original version was completed at Metis and was presented as my third data science project. Now that the bootcamp is complete, I decided to redo this project in order to create a more robust model.

Instead of relying on a random oversampler and random undersample, I tried several more sophisticated techniques. These techniques were SMOTE oversampling, ADASYN oversampling, NearMiss Undersampling version 1, and NearMiss undersampling version 2. I also found a threshold that was much higher than my original model. 

Finally, I constructed a simple flask app for version 2.
