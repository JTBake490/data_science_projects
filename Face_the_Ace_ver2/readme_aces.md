The objective of this project was to find out how serveral tennis player attributes contribute to the number of aces a professional tennis player will hit in a 52 week perioed.

This was the second project I conducted at Metis. I made use of linear regression for this project.

Edit: After graduating from Metis, I decided to redo this project. The original notebook has been replaced. However, the original PowerPoint presentation is still posted in this repo. The new PowerPoint presentation is titled 'tennis_aces_ver2'.
