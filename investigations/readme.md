Investigation were small side projects while at Metis. The purpose was to explore other aspects of Data Science or computer engineering without going to in depth.

For my investigations, I decided to explore:
- the SymPy library
- Chess engines
    * min-max vs neural nets
    * comparison between humans and engines

Any investigations I may conduct in the future will be added.
