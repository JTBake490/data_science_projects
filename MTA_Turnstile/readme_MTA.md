This turnstile project was done in collaboration with Jake Niederer and Diamon Dunlap.
This was the first data science project conducted at Metis. The purpose was to find the optimal train stations to set up a fundraising
table if one were to trying to collect signatures for a fund raising event.

This project was performed with only the introduction to serveral data science tools and before learning about traditional machine learning techniques.
