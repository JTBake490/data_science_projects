The objective of this project was to find out how serveral tennis player attributes contribute to the number of aces a professional tennis player will hit in a 52 week perioed.

This was the second project I conducted at Metis. I made use of linear regression for this project.

Edit: After graduating from Metis, I decided to redo this project. The original note book has been replaced. However, the original PowerPoint presentation is still posted in this repo. The new PowerPoint presentation is titled 'Face the Ace ver.2'.
